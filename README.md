# CPSC-112 CLASS PROJECT
## Project Title: Image Converter GUI Application

### Startup -
Our GUI application only requires two files to work
properly: ImageConverterGUI.java and placeholder.gif.
Place both files in the same directory, compile the Java
file, and then run ImageConverterGUI. 

### Using the program -
Press the “Select a File” button (either by clicking or 
pressing the enter key) and select an image file (jpg,
gif, or png). A sample image to be used with the converter 
was included in the submission (“yankeelogo.jpg”), but any
jpg, gif, or png file should work. Next, select a 
conversion option (3 sizes of ASCII, grayscale, and 
negative color) by clicking one of the buttons along the 
bottom of the GUI where the file upload button used to be. 
Options can be cycled between for the current image without 
resetting the program. Pressing the reset button below the 
title will return the application to its startup state and 
allow for a new image to be uploaded. Lastly, for each 
conversion that is selected, a file will be created in the 
directory containing the converted image, only one for 
each conversion option.

### A note on ASCII output -
For certain images, the ASCII representation does
not look very good, so it is recommended to copy and 
paste the text (using control a or command a to select 
the text from the GUI text area) into a text file or 
look at “results.txt” which will have been created in 
the source code’s directory. The output looks best at 
a very small font (e.g. 1 or 2) in a plain text format.

### A note on uploaded images - 
All jpg, gif, and png images should work with this
program, but very large files may lead to long loading
times for the conversions, so it is recommended to use 
images of reasonable size. For this same reason, it is
recommended to use the smaller ASCII output option for 
larger images.
